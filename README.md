# Vectorization
I wrote a code which vectorizes the for loop. The main problem is to create an array and store the sum of two other array numbers.

Using vectorization the program became about 8 times faster. To check this you can use clang compiler, flags for optimization (-O3) and flag for vectorization (-fvectorize).
